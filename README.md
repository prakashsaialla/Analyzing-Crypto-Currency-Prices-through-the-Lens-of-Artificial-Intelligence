# 📊 Analyzing Crypto Currency Prices through the Lens of Artificial Intelligence

## 🔍 Project Overview

Cryptocurrency markets are highly dynamic, volatile, and complex, making price prediction a challenging task for traders and analysts. This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — particularly machine learning and deep learning models — to analyze and understand cryptocurrency price dynamics such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. It explores how different approaches like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks perform in capturing short- and long-term patterns in price time series.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   Historical price data for multiple cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple) is collected and prepared for analysis.

2. **Preprocessing**
   The data is cleaned and transformed into features suitable for AI models.

3. **Modeling Using AI**

   * **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** are applied to learn long-term dependencies in price history.
   * **LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks** focus on short-term temporal patterns.
     The project compares how these models capture the dynamics of crypto price movements.
